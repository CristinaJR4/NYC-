I am thrilled to share my first solo Excel project, which involved analyzing the NYC Traffic Accident dataset provided by Maven Analytics. After collecting the data, I used filters to become familiar with it and removed columns that did not add value to my analysis. I then formatted the date and time column to my specifications.
To summarize and analyze the data, I created several pivot tables and charts that made the data easy to read. My goal was to identify which boroughs had the most injuries and deaths, as well as the time of day when injuries and deaths were most frequently noted. Additionally, I created an overview of injuries and deaths on a monthly and yearly basis. I was also able to determine which vehicles and contributing factors caused injury and/or death.
To make the data more accessible, I added a slicer to break down the totals by borough. I am open to any suggestions to help me improve my analysis further.
